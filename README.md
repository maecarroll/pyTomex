# pyTomex

**Py**thon scripts for the **T**ypology **O**f **M**orphological **EX**ponence.

An implementation of 'exponence as informativeness' from Carroll (2021), useful for working out exponence patterns in inflectional paradigms. It also classifies paradigms with respect to the typology of verbose exponence. Plan to expand.

## Data

A segmented inflected lexicon with cell values in separate columns. A sample dataset has been included in ./example_data/ngkolmpu_data_example.csv.  


## Included functions:

See pyTomex_ovewview.ipynb for the various functions.
